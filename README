Module with conditional logic, time consuming functions and many 
resources.  Purely for testing purposes.

The shit_logic base class includes some conditional logic and a really
crappy function to waste time.

Each c_XXXX class includes 10 file resources that are derived from
the fqdn_rand() function. Each class includes the N-1 class.

To include 500 unique resources include c_0050; for 1000 resources 
include c_00100.
